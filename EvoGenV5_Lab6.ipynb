    "### Simulation\n",
    "Most of our labs in this course are driven by data, but simulation is one of the major tools of computational research. How do we know if our motif or any other pattern may have biological significance? The first step is to determine if it occurs more frequently than expected in a randomized set of sequences or other data. Simulation studies are already an important part of ecology, epidemiology and evolution where models are needed to predict trajectories of environmental change and where simulation studies are used to test theory that is not testable by current laboratory methods. Increasingly simulation is used in the study of basic cellular processes, like the cell cycle and protein export and it is an important tool in the growing field of Systems Biology in which computer models of cells and organisms are being developed to understand and predict drug response. In many of these models mutation is a fundamental component.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Number Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "A random number generator generates a sequence of numbers or symbols that lack any pattern, i.e. appear random.  However, the Python and most random number generators are not truly random but rely algorithms for generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers.  Thus they are often called Pseuorandom number generators.  This is fine for us because we are not developing software for security purposes. "
